# Classical brick breaker game

## how to play
Press left arrow key or right arrow key to move the paddle to bounce up the ball and break bricks. 

Press space bar to restart the game when the game is over or paused.

## bug
Sometimes the winMsg or LoseMsg won't show up, and im still trying to fix it. But, basic mechanisms of the game should be fine.
